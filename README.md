# 03 Treasure Island

This is the **Day 3 Challenge** from Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp. This project demonstrates the following skills:
- Conditionals with If/Else Statements
- Modulo Operator
- Nested If Statements and Using Elif
- Logical Operators

## Project Description

Treasure Island is a simple text-based adventure game where the player must make a series of decisions to navigate through different scenarios. Each decision determines the player's fate, whether it's finding the treasure or encountering an unfortunate end. The game tests decision-making skills through multiple conditional paths and uses nested if/else statements to handle the game's logic.

## How It Works

1. The game starts with a scenario where the player is presented with a crossroad and must choose which direction to go—left or right.
2. Based on the player's choice, they will either move forward or face a game over.
3. The player will encounter a lake and must choose to either swim across or wait for a boat.
4. If they wait for a boat, they arrive at an island and are presented with three colored doors (red, yellow, and blue). Choosing the right door leads to the treasure, while the other doors lead to various game-over situations.
5. The game ends when the player either finds the treasure or encounters a fatal scenario.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
4. Run the script with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
